# cscd378-portfolio

## Goals

We hope to have a project portfolio site with individual portfolios for each of our team members, as well as administration capabilities. The project section of the site will detail the technologies we used in developing the site as well as how we fulfilled the given requirements for the project. Each individual portfolio will contain descriptions of the person’s qualifications, including a biography, resume, projects. Finally, the administration section will have a login system and a log of the site’s access history.
